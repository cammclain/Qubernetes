# Should I use Ansible?



I am wanting to create a setup system for my Q8S cluster, allowing me (or anyone on GitHub) to easily configure and launch a new cluster with ease!


The idea is that you only have to load up a node with a fresh install of Debian, and then clone the repo and run the setup script.

I want to make it so that you can configure multiple nodes at once as long as they have SSH access to each other.

like, i want to be able to pass a list of credentials and IPs and have it configure all the nodes.

So I am wondering if Ansible is the way to go, or if there is something else that would be better?

I am not dead set on Ansible, or using SSH, I am open to other ideas.

I am focused on privacy and security, so I want to make sure that whatever I choose is secure and easy to understand.
