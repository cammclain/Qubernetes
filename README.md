Hereâ€™s a clearer outline for your Q8S project:

---

### **Q8S: Kubernetes Meets Qubes OS**
**Tagline**: Advanced isolation, security, and anonymity for Kubernetes.

---

### **Core Architecture**
1. **Dom0 (Kubeadm)**:
   - Acts as the central "control domain" for managing clusters (vclusters).
   - Hosts the custom Q8S management panel accessible via a Tor hidden service.

2. **vCluster Integration**:
   - Each vcluster acts as an isolated environment for specific purposes, analogous to Qubes' VMs.
   - Easy-to-create disposable clusters with strict network and lifecycle controls.
   - Template-based workflows for rapid deployment and reproducibility.

---

### **Key Features**
1. **Isolation**:
   - Strict separation between clusters using Kubernetes namespaces and vcluster boundaries.
   - RBAC policies for fine-grained access control.
   - Integration with PodSecurityPolicies or Open Policy Agent for enhanced isolation.

2. **Security**:
   - Encrypted cluster communication using a self hosted Cert-manager `smallstep` instance.
   - Integration with Kubernetes security tools (Falco, Kyverno, etc.).
   - Support for signing workloads and configurations with Sigstore.

3. **Anonymity & Networking**:
   - Tor hidden services for management panel and API server.
   - Built-in support for SOCKS5 proxies, alternative Onion-routing (Nym, Lokinet, etc.) for egress traffic.
   - Networking clusters for isolated and filtered internet-facing workloads.
   - DNS-over-HTTPS and DNS-over-TLS for secure DNS resolution.
   - VPN configuration files can be loaded into pods on the cluster, and then exposed as a service on the cluster or hidden service for access to the internet through VPN providers (NordVPN, Mullvad, etc.).

4. **Templates**:
   - Pre-defined templates for storage, networking, compute, and disposable clusters.
   - "Offline vault" cluster for secure storage of sensitive data.
   - use of NixOS containers for disposable environments within disposable clusters allowing you to create containers with specific software and configurations.

---

### **Cluster Types**
1. **Storage Vault Cluster**:
   - Offline by default, activated for specific tasks.
   - Can use tools like Rook or Longhorn for high-availability storage.

2. **Disposable Clusters**:
   - Designed for short-term, stateless workloads.
   - Automatically destroyed after use.

3. **Networking Clusters**:
   - Handle external connections, VPNs, Tor gateways, or network filtering.

4. **General Compute Clusters**:
   - Serve typical application needs with isolation at the cluster level.

---

### **Custom Management Panel**
1. **Features**:
   - User-friendly UI for managing vclusters and dom0.
   - Tor hidden service for remote access user:password authentication.
   - SurrealDB for persistent storage of metadata. (proxies, credentials, etc.)
   - Template deployment and lifecycle management.

2. **Tech Stack**:
   - Backend: Go (Echo)
   - HTML Templates 
   - CSS: Bulma.io
   - JS: NO JS



---

### **Planned Workflows**
1. **Integration with Qubes OS**:
   - Use Qubes as a management workstation to access Q8S securely.
   - Torsocks for secure API communication.

2. **Cluster Lifecycle Management**:
   - Deploy templates for specific needs.
   - Scale or destroy clusters dynamically.

3. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Secure access with WireGuard or Onion authentication.
   - Isolated logging and monitoring (e.g., Loki, Prometheus).

---

### **Future Directions**
1. **Enhanced Anonymity**:
   - Build-in decoy traffic and traffic obfuscation tools.
   - Support Oblivious HTTP or other privacy-preserving protocols.

2. **Expanded Template Library**:
   - Add templates for CI/CD, AI/ML workloads, and security testing.

3. **Open Source Community**:
   - Create an ecosystem of user-contributed templates and plugins.

I have created my repo on github, and I have cloned it in my local development environment.

Please help me create a plan for the project, and then I will create a project board and assign tasks to myself.


Please provide detailed steps and instructions for the project along with example code and documentation.

Thank you!
